Currently supported
-------------------

- Easily train pose-based isolated sign language recognizers (ISLR)
   - Currently supports 4 different models
- Support for many run-time augmentations for pose keypoints
   - Check for complete list of pose transforms
- Support for efficient inference
   - Check for more details: 
- Easily pre-train models using monolingual SL data
   - And fine-tune on any small ISLR dataset
- All Training and Inference is completely config-based
   - No-code required
   - Check for example configs:
